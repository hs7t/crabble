## Playing
*   Pick a mode - Lightning, Infinite, or Spooky!
    -   In Lighting mode, solve a set of three puzzles.
    -   In Infinite mode, solve as many puzzles as you want (until you run out
        of puzzles, because there aren't that many :sob:)
    -   In Spooky mode, solve a set of three puzzles - but spooky!

*   Solve a puzzle by ordering each series of words within it correctly.
    -   Use `Q` or `W` to select words.
    -   Use `Space` to pick up a word. Then, use your arrow keys to move it.
    -   Hit `Space` again to set down the word.
    -   Not using a keyboard? Don't worry. Drag any word to set it in the right place.

*   Keep an eye on the time!
    -   Moving a word gives you more time.
    -   You'll lose if you run out of time.
