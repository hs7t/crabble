# Crabble

A fast-paced word game where you unscramble strings of words.

## Playing with the keyboard
- Use `Q` and `W` to select previous and next word blocks, respectively.
- Hit `Space` after selecting a word block to pick it up. Use your left and
    right arrow keys (`←`, `→`) to move it to the right place, and hit `Space`
    again to set it down.
